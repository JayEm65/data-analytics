# Ironhack Data Analytics (Part-Time Remote)

This repository contains teaching material from the Ironhack Data Analytics bootcamp for the Remote Part-Time cohort. It is based on multiple internal curriculums and it's intended to pull together and expand on the material prepared by fellow Ironhack teachers: David Henriquez, Deborah Gabisson, Goncalo Jardim, and Xisca Sorrell. 

References will be added to the particular notebooks with new iterations of this repository.
